#Cat

##this 
is a little cat

##Description
This little cat will hang out on your desktop and just vibe. It is animated and can walk
part of the way across the screen, and will resize the window when doing so. Eventually,
the actual window should be replaced by a fake window in order to make this more functional,
and because the windows APIs for window resizing don't allow for this to be done gracefully- 
for now it was more of a fun proof of concept.


##To Do:
 * Give cat different status bars for things like hunger, fun, cleanliness
 * Make window fullscreen (still transparent) and add my own "window".
 * edit font to make it all a little more aesthetic
